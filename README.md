## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **tech enthusiast** deeply passionate about merging the realms of technology, learning, and focus. My focus is on developing innovative instructional technology solutions and delving into the world of open-source alternatives for project management. My programming journey began with `Java`, `C#`, `HTML`, and `CSS`, primarily to address various system implementation needs.

I'm currently on an exciting learning path in secure software development, thanks to the Coding for Veterans program and the University of Ottawa. This journey is enhancing my skill set with `Python`,`C++`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, `Docker`, and `Kubernetes`. I am committed to using these skills to craft impactful, user-centric technological tools.

Stay tuned for updates on my projects and feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions!
